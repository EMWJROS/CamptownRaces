  De Camptown ladies sing dis song. Doo-da. Doo-da.
  De Camptown racetrack's five miles long. Oh doo-da day.
  I went down dah with my hat caved in. Doo-da. Doo-da.
  I came back home with a pocket full of tin. Oh doo-da day.

  Gwine to race all night. 
  Gwine to race all day.
  I bet my money on a bob-tailed nag.
  Somebody bet on the bay.
  
  De long tail filly and de big black hoss, Doo-da. Doo-da.
  Dey fly de track and de both cut across. Oh doo-da day.
  De blind hoss sticken in a big mud hole, Doo-da. Doo-da.
  Can't touch bottom with a ten foot pole. Oh doo-da day.

  Gwine to race all night. 
  Gwine to race all day.
  I bet my money on a bob-tailed nag.
  Somebody bet on the bay.
